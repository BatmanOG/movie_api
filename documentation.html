        <h1>Movie Api</h1>

        <p>the point of this project is to familularize myself with creating an applications 
            backend server and api through the guidance of careerfoundry. when completed this the user 
            will be able to search for a movie by it genre, actors, or director and find other information 
            on said movies. this will be done using powershell and node.js and multiple modules included with it and third party 
            modules as well. users will be able to create a profile and and save information on movies they like or want to see. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I added Express framework to aid in the creation of the server and morgan to log it all in the log.txt file 
        </p>
        <p>in this app the user will be able to create a profile with a username and password to save their favorite movies and informtion about that movie and update their persona information. the user will also be able to 
            look up movies by name, genre, year, actors, and director.
        </p>
